description: Reiki is not 'taught' as such. Instead, the person who would like to perform Reiki is given an attunement, which can only be given by a Reiki Master.

A Reiki attunement is a process of empowerment that opens the chakras needed for working as a Reiki healer. It connects you to the unlimited source of Reiki energy and, for a time after the attunement, changes will be made by the energy, which opens your system â€” enabling you to channel Reiki. These changes take place metaphysically in the chakras and the aura as well as the physical body. An emotional as well as toxic release can take place as part of this clearing process.

Prior to your attunement you will be given a checklist, which should be completed 3 to 5 days beforehand.

## Reiki 1 or Reiki 1st Degree

For Reiki 1, four attunements are performed, whereas each remaining level requires one only.

The process takes a couple of minutes, but once all four attunements have been received Reiki will be with you for life. Should you ignore it or decide not to use it, but in years to come decide to take this up again, then it will still be with you. In other words, you can tap into it at any time.

It is also about you becoming a balanced person and Reiki healer. You still need to put your own wellbeing first in order to be a good clear channel for healing.

This level is for family, friends, pets and animals. (Please note: you cannot charge anyone on this level.)

Your attunement will consist of:

- Being shown the hand positions for full body treatment, front and back.
- Hand positions for self-healing.
- Hand positions for healing whilst person is seated.
- How to use Reiki on plants and animals.

## Reiki II or 2nd Degree

You will be taught the 3 symbols, power, mental/emotional and distance healing symbols. Reiki II is sometimes referred to as Reiki Practitioner. At this level you can charge for your time whilst giving treatments and obtain insurance.

## Reiki Master/Teacher

For people who wish to attune others into this wonderful system of healing and a willingness to commit to Reiki into their professional and personal lives.

**Reiki Master** - You will receive the Master power symbol and be shown how to do psychic surgery.

**Reiki Teacher** - You will receive the two teaching symbols and be shown how to attune others.
