## What is Reiki?

Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is also a form of spiritual healing. A treatment feels like a radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person, including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feels of peace, security and well-being. Many have reported miraculous results.

## What to expect during a treatment

Upon arrival, you may wish to tell me the reason for your visit. Some clients don't, as they just come for the relaxation after a hard week's work. You will then be asked to lie down on the massage bed, fully clothed. There is a heated underblanket and you will then be covered with an overblanket to keep you warm and comfortable. There is soft background music to help you relax. I then talk you through the process so you know what to expect. I also ask you to be aware of any colours or sensations that you may experience during your treatment â€” don't worry if you don't. Most clients fall asleep. I then tell you to relax and enjoy the experience.

*Treatments last around 45 minutes.*

## What clients say after the treatment

Most clients feel refreshed and extremely relaxed. You will be given a glass of water. I will ask you to drink plenty of water during the day after your treatment, as your body releases toxins and unwanted stale energy from your body. This is short lived and very positive. During the evening you may start to feel quite tired. This is normal, its your body's way of healing.

## How often should I have a treatment?

This depends on the reason for your treatment in the first place. There is no time scale, just whenever you feel ready.
