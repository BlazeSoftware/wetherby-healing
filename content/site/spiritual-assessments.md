A Spiritual Assessment provides practical advice for your spiritual growth and journey. Deborah is able to connect with you on a spiritual level, allowing you to work together to discover your strengths and weakness as they relate to your life path.

From identifying obstacles to overcome to areas of opportunity to further develop, your spiritual assessment will provide you with help and guidance where needed by tuning into your guides, sometimes we have blockages due to our past which need to be addressed. This may include past-life traumas to acknowledge and overcome, to identifying areas of growth that need to be further maintained. Additionally, as a psychic medium, Deborah is able to offer continual guidance along your spiritual journey as well.
