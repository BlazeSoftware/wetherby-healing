## What is Reiki?

Reiki is a Japanese technique that promotes relaxation, reduces stress and encourages healing. There is an unseen life force energy flowing through us. If this is at a low ebb, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress. If it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy. Reiki is administered by the laying on of hands. The treatment is aimed at the whole person, including body, emotions, mind and spirit, and should leave you with feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. It's simple, natural and safe to use in conjunction with any other medical or therapeutic techniques.

## Attunements

The ability to use Reiki is simple to learn and is transferred to students during a class, known as an â€˜attunement', given by a Reiki master. Students will then be able to use their new skills to enhance the quality of other people's lives.
