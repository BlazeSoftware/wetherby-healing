# Why choose Reiki for our animals?

- Animal Reiki is a gentle complimentary therapy done by meditation, allowing the animal to come into the gentle healing space, it is very subtle and the effects are powerful!
- Reiki needs only two key ingredients, your intention and the animal’s acceptance.
- Reiki can effectively address any problem an animal may face: physical, mental, emotional or spiritual.
- Reiki will heal the origin of the problem, even if it is not known.  We do not need to diagnose (nor is it our job to!)
- Reiki can also heal the situation. Its nature is to bring healing and balance, and thus to receive each treatment in the ways most comfortable for them.
- You can’t overdo “Reiki.” Reiki will not give more healing and/or energy to the animal than he or she is open to receive.
- Reiki always heals on some level, even if you don’t see an outward solution it works safely with all other forms of healing, both allopathic and holistic.
