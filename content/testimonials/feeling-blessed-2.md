title: Feeling Blessed
description: >
  I went to see Deborah with an open mind but feeling very nervous as I've never
  been to anyone before. Deborah made me feel relaxed and comfortable and
  explained what could be done.


  I had a spiritual reading before the have my tarot cards read.  She was able to tell me facts about my late husband that she would not of known about. 


  The cards really hit lots of nails about myself my current situation and that steps I am taking are the right steps.


  Some things that were said I couldn't take but my mind is open for the future.


  Thank you so much.
