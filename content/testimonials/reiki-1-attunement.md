title: Reiki 1 attunement
description: I worked with Deborah to complete my level 1 Reiki attunement, with
  a view to adding it as a treatment to my Holistic Therapy business in the
  future. I recieved Reiki treatments about 10 years ago but I didn't know what
  to expect with regards to giving and felt very nervous going in. Deborah
  really made me feel at ease and she is so easy to talk to. It was so
  interesting to receive the attunement and chat about what we both experienced.
  I was also given the opportunity to practice a treatment on Deborah and she
  gave me some great feedback. It's been an amazing experience and I look
  forward to expanding my skills further with Deborah in the future.
