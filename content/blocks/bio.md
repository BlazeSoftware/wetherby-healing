I am a Reiki practitioner and psychic based in Wetherby. I became a qualified Reiki Master in 2013 after five years of study and, as well as healing others, I pass on the gift of knowledge through teaching, or _attunements_. I also give psychic and spiritual readings using the tarot, crystals or personal objects that people bring to me.
