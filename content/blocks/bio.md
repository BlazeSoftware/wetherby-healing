I am a Psychic Spiritulist Medium  and Reiki Master based in Wetherby. I became a qualified Reiki Master in 2013 after five years of study and, as well as healing others, I pass on the gift of knowledge through teaching, or *attunements*. I also give psychic and spiritual readings using the tarot, crystals or personal objects that people bring to me.
