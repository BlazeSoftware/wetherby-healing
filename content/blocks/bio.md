I am a Psychic Spiritulist Medium and a Reiki Master based in Wetherby. I became a qualified Reiki Master in 2013 after five years of study and, as well as healing others, I pass on the gift of knowledge through teaching, or *attunements*. I also do tarot readings, crystal readings, photo readings and I can use personal objects that people bring to me to tune into.
